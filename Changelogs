-- 1.0.5
  - Yapper's editbox should no longer be able to be opened while UI is hidden, and will close automatically if it is open when hiding the UI.

  - Hitting Enter to chat in the event editbox is still open after a lockdown has begun, will now save it as a draft and close with a warning, instead of allowing it to trigger a reserved action error.

-- 1.0.4
  - Added channel memory to chat history. Yapper remembers which channels you sent posts to and will target those channels when you recall them with alt+up/down.
  - Fixed a bug where system chat commands (like /reload) were not added to the chat history.
  - Tightened up the use of delineators in the posting system to make it a little easier to integrate with.

-- 1.0.3
  - Reverted bugfix from 1.0.2 that unhooked LibGopher, breaking addons like CrossRP.
  - Added new bridge module that detects if LibGopher is present, and forwards our processed messages to it for queueing.

-- 1.0.2
  - Bugfix: Due to the way we now operate, the regular patch for Gopher no longer worked. Since Yapper does
            basically everything Gopher does, functionally, we just unhook it from everything when it's present.
            This had caused issued with CrossRP before, and may cause issues with other addons that implement Gopher.
            Needless to say, UCM and EmoteSplitter will not be compatible with Yapper due to this.

-- 1.0.1
  - In-game UI to change settings. See addon compartment, minimap button (if supported) or type '/yapper' in chat.

  - New accessibility options!
    - Better text styling controls, can set font size, outline mode, and per-channel colour customization!
    - Background styling for the edit box, set to any colour combination and opacity!

  - Improved chat label behavior and sticky-channel handling, including reduced BNet handoff issues.
  - Improved message-splitting marker handling and spacing behavior. Now customisable!
  - Better undo/redo reliability and local SavedVariables migration safety.

  Known Issues:
    - Rare BNet editbox contention can still occur in some whisper transition sequences.
    - Workaround: type `/s` or `/say` (without trailing whitespace) and press Enter to recover cleanly.

-- 1.0.0
    - FULL REFACTOR
    - DOES NOT TAINT BLIZZARD'S EDITBOX!
    - Improved post splitting.
    - Allows chatter to continue during lockdowns.
    - Now creates a custom chat frame while out of chat lockdown, and uses Blizzard's otherwise.
    - Near parity with Blizzard's EditBox.
    - Much-needed cleanup.
    - API compatibility system REMOVED (pending rework)
    - Began work on customisability options like font sizes and types. (Not Yet Implemented)
    - Draft system that saves your messages as you type them, and lets you recover them
      in the event you disconnect or reload, or otherwise have your editbox closed on you.
    - Per-character persistent post history (up to 50 posts saved, use alt+up/down to navigate)
    - Saves your post as a draft if you enter an encounter while typing, allowing you to recover it
      after it's over.

-- 0.9
    - New post queue system with confirmation-based ordering for EMOTE/GUILD.
    - SAY/YELL now send in batches of 3 per Enter press (avoids WoW throttle drops).
    - TRP3 integration: RP names now work correctly with message confirmation.
    - Added Escape key to cancel in-progress posts.
    - Item links now pause batching (they require hardware events).
    - Configurable throttle settings (BATCH_SIZE, BATCH_THROTTLE, STALL_TIMEOUT).
    - Code cleanup: removed unused legacy functions.

-- 0.8.2
    - Changed versioning system.
    - Implemented visual segmentation when splitting (use of >>).
    - Fixed an issue causing whispers to be erroneously attempted split.
    - Fixed a bug causing edit box to become unresponsive after an erroneous whisper split.

-- 0.8c
    - Created an early (currently clunky) framework for adding compatibility patches,
      including API exposure so developers can add their own patches. This is currently undocumented and
      extremely limited, I do not recommend using it yourselves yet.
    - Implemented compatibility patch for Gopher. *Should* preserve Gopher's own features while using
      Yapper's own chat implementations. This should allow Yapper to be used in conjunction with addons
      using Gopher, like CrossRP.
    - Implemented a fix for Prat's sticky channels.

    TODO:
            - Improve the posting queue to make it more robust and at the very least match Gopher's verification.

-- 0.8b
    * Added some cleanup functions for extra memory management.
    * Patched a memory leak. You will see memory rise during active usage, but it should peak at a reasonable level and
      go back down again on its own.

-- 0.8
    * Completely refactored the entire codebase.
    * Streamlined multiple event and hooking methods.
    * Improved chat handling.
    * Error handling is better.
    * Fixed issue causing Yapper to block macros (but /target, /petattack and other protected commands don't work in the chat window)
    * Reduced throttling to 0.5s when multiposting.
    * Multiple performance optimisations; Yapper should be even faster now and able to keep up with even the most enthusiastic typist!

-- 0.7
    * Added message throttling. If post produces more than 3 messages, require enter presses at 1s intervals (enforced) to clear queue.
      Posts 2 messages at a time until queue cleared.
    * Removed RecolourEmote() function as it didn't work anyway and TRP handles that.

-- 0.6b
    * Yapper confirmed to work in Midnight Beta.

-- 0.6
	* Minor polish and practice getting metadata. The greeting looks better, I guess?
    * Removed some unused variables, cleaned out some commented-out features.
    * Added details and usage terms to yapper.lua.
    * Updated TOC.

-- 0.5
    * Added word-wrapping in an effort to stop the add-on splitting the text in the middle of a word.

-- 0.4
    * Fixed issue causing split messages to fail to display target markers like {square} etc.
