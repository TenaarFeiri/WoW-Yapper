-- 1.0.0
    - FULL REFACTOR
    - DOES NOT TAINT BLIZZARD'S EDITBOX!
    - Improved post splitting.
    - Allows chatter to continue during lockdowns.
    - Now creates a custom chat frame while out of chat lockdown, and uses Blizzard's otherwise.
    - Near parity with Blizzard's EditBox.
    - Much-needed cleanup.
    - API compatibility system REMOVED (pending rework)
    - Began work on customisability options like font sizes and types. (Not Yet Implemented)
    - Draft system that saves your messages as you type them, and lets you recover them
      in the event you disconnect or reload, or otherwise have your editbox closed on you.
    - Per-character persistent post history (up to 50 posts saved, use alt+up/down to navigate)
    - Saves your post as a draft if you enter an encounter while typing, allowing you to recover it
      after it's over.

-- 0.9
    - New post queue system with confirmation-based ordering for EMOTE/GUILD.
    - SAY/YELL now send in batches of 3 per Enter press (avoids WoW throttle drops).
    - TRP3 integration: RP names now work correctly with message confirmation.
    - Added Escape key to cancel in-progress posts.
    - Item links now pause batching (they require hardware events).
    - Configurable throttle settings (BATCH_SIZE, BATCH_THROTTLE, STALL_TIMEOUT).
    - Code cleanup: removed unused legacy functions.

-- 0.8.2
    - Changed versioning system.
    - Implemented visual segmentation when splitting (use of >>).
    - Fixed an issue causing whispers to be erroneously attempted split.
    - Fixed a bug causing edit box to become unresponsive after an erroneous whisper split.

-- 0.8c
    - Created an early (currently clunky) framework for adding compatibility patches,
      including API exposure so developers can add their own patches. This is currently undocumented and
      extremely limited, I do not recommend using it yourselves yet.
    - Implemented compatibility patch for Gopher. *Should* preserve Gopher's own features while using
      Yapper's own chat implementations. This should allow Yapper to be used in conjunction with addons
      using Gopher, like CrossRP.
    - Implemented a fix for Prat's sticky channels.

    TODO:
            - Improve the posting queue to make it more robust and at the very least match Gopher's verification.

-- 0.8b
    * Added some cleanup functions for extra memory management.
    * Patched a memory leak. You will see memory rise during active usage, but it should peak at a reasonable level and
      go back down again on its own.

-- 0.8
    * Completely refactored the entire codebase.
    * Streamlined multiple event and hooking methods.
    * Improved chat handling.
    * Error handling is better.
    * Fixed issue causing Yapper to block macros (but /target, /petattack and other protected commands don't work in the chat window)
    * Reduced throttling to 0.5s when multiposting.
    * Multiple performance optimisations; Yapper should be even faster now and able to keep up with even the most enthusiastic typist!

-- 0.7
    * Added message throttling. If post produces more than 3 messages, require enter presses at 1s intervals (enforced) to clear queue.
      Posts 2 messages at a time until queue cleared.
    * Removed RecolourEmote() function as it didn't work anyway and TRP handles that.

-- 0.6b
    * Yapper confirmed to work in Midnight Beta.

-- 0.6
	* Minor polish and practice getting metadata. The greeting looks better, I guess?
    * Removed some unused variables, cleaned out some commented-out features.
    * Added details and usage terms to yapper.lua.
    * Updated TOC.

-- 0.5
    * Added word-wrapping in an effort to stop the add-on splitting the text in the middle of a word.

-- 0.4
    * Fixed issue causing split messages to fail to display target markers like {square} etc.
