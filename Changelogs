    * Added some cleanup functions for extra memory management.
    * Patched a memory leak. You will see memory rise during active usage, but it should peak at a reasonable level and
      go back down again on its own.

-- 0.8
    * Completely refactored the entire codebase.
    * Streamlined multiple event and hooking methods.
    * Improved chat handling.
    * Error handling is better.
    * Fixed issue causing Yapper to block macros (but /target, /petattack and other protected commands don't work in the chat window)
    * Reduced throttling to 0.5s when multiposting.
    * Multiple performance optimisations; Yapper should be even faster now and able to keep up with even the most enthusiastic typist!

-- 0.7
    * Added message throttling. If post produces more than 3 messages, require enter presses at 1s intervals (enforced) to clear queue.
      Posts 2 messages at a time until queue cleared.
    * Removed RecolourEmote() function as it didn't work anyway and TRP handles that.

-- 0.6b
    * Yapper confirmed to work in Midnight Beta.

-- 0.6
	* Minor polish and practice getting metadata. The greeting looks better, I guess?
    * Removed some unused variables, cleaned out some commented-out features.
    * Added details and usage terms to yapper.lua.
    * Updated TOC.

-- 0.5
    * Added word-wrapping in an effort to stop the add-on splitting the text in the middle of a word.

-- 0.4
    * Fixed issue causing split messages to fail to display target markers like {square} etc.
