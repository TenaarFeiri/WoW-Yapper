# WoW-Yapper
Definitely no longer a "minimalist" stand-in for addons like EmoteSplitter.
## Please download the addon from here: https://github.com/TenaarFeiri/WoW-Yapper/releases

Yapper WAS meant to be a simple, no-interface no-options works-out-of-the-box stand-in/replacement for 
addons like EmoteSplitter. It has since exploded in scope thanks to patch 12.0.0 but I'm taking up the challenge, I guess.
It's my first addon and my first foray into Lua!
