Yapper is meant to be a simple, no-interface no-options works-out-of-the-box stand-in/replacement for 
addons like EmoteSplitter. It's my first addon and my first foray into Lua and I'm still learning
how best to accomplish things.
Yapper is designed to be fully independent; it relies on no dependencies and attempts to follow the principles
of "maximum results for minimum work". I'll probably optimise things down the line, as I get better at this.

Yapper should be resistant to future patches, given its contained nature, but who knows what Midnight will bring.
